Description
This Streamlit project allows users to explore and compare the performance of different machine learning classifiers. The app provides an interactive interface to select datasets and classifiers, adjust hyperparameters, and visualize the classification results. The implemented classifiers include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. Users can see the shape of the selected dataset, the number of classes, and the accuracy of the chosen classifier. Additionally, the app offers a PCA-based 2D visualization of the dataset.

Features
Dataset Selection: Choose from three different datasets (Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer).
Classifier Selection: Compare three different classifiers (KNN, SVM, Random Forest).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust hyperparameters for each classifier using interactive sliders.
Performance Metrics: Display the accuracy of the selected classifier.
Data Visualization: Visualize the dataset in 2D using PCA.
